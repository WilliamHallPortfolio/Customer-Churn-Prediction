# Customer-Churn-Prediction
The goal for this project is to investigate the reasons for the high customer churn plaguing a fictional company, Telco. For some who are unfamiliar with customer churn is, churn happens when customers are unhappy with the services a company provides and decides to take their business elsewhere. This is extremely distressing for companies due to the loss of revenue when each customer terminates their service. This problem primarily persists in credit card companies, cable service providers, and telecommunication companies. These affected companies go to great lengths to retain customers as it is much cheaper to make them happy than to acquire new ones. Nowadays, there are few switching costs for customers who leave and rarely any penalties imposed due to companies not requiring contracts upon sign-up. In this case, we will group at-risk customers and use data mining to predict which group will likely stay or leave for another service.
